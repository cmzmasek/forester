# Forester
Forester is a collection of open source libraries of Java and Ruby software for phylogenomics and evolutionary biology research.

This repositoty is a fork of the original Forester project at https://github.com/cmzmasek/forester. 

The only difference of this fork with respect to the original is that the java part of the code has been mavenised for ease of use and better integration with other maven-based projects such as [Biojava](https://github.com/biojava/biojava)
